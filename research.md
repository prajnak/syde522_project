# Indian Agricultural Data available data features

## List of Features (Dates available)
* available land usage ()
* total land cultivated
* area under principal crops
* yield of principal crops
* amount of agricultural subsidies
	* breakdown of subsidies based on crop production, livestock , animal husbandry, 
	* differences between subsidies that are credit vs direct cash subsidies vs discounts for agricultural resources like fertilizers, seeds, irrigation resources etc

## Factors affecting crop yield
A. Climatic

	* temperature
	* precipitation

B. Edaphic
	
	* soil moisture levels
	* soil aeration
	* soil temperature

C. Biotic

	* crop rotation effects
	* Animals (insects, livestock, honeybees, earthworms)
D. Phsiographic

	* topography
	* altitude
E. Socio-economic

	* governmental subsidies
	* demand for certain crops (cash crop farmers)



## Slides Breakdown
### Problem -> Crop yield prediction with regional (districts/municipality) resolution
#### A common approach
is to use statistical models trained on historical yields and some simplified measurements of weather, such as growing season average temperature and precipitation
