% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.

% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
Neural Networks and Multiple Adaptive Regressive Splines (MARS), were used to predict crop yield for cereals for the country of India. Historical annual cereal yield data from 1960-2010 for the country of India was used as target data with seasonal mean temperatures, precipitation and arable land size as predictors. The two models were trained with this data and their predictions were compared with the actual yields as well as the performance of more complex crop models.

\section{Introduction}
Climate change has brought about increasingly chaotic weather patterns all over the planet making national economic and resource planning difficult for researchers, independent contractors and government organizations. These entities are therefore paying increased attention to the crop forecasts of major food-exporting countries as well as to their own domestic food production. Given the increased volatility of food markets and the rising incidence of climatic extremes affecting food production, food price spikes may increase in prevalence in future years \cite{iizumi2013prediction}. As such, complex models that can simulate ensemble effects from climate and soil conditions while accounting for geographical variability have assumed paramount importance. Crop growth models perform an abstraction of the dynamic mechanistic of the plant’s physiological stages by fitting them into a mathematical model \cite{Gonzalez-Sanchez2014}.

Recent research in this area has sought to build statistical models that perform just as well at forecasting yields as the complex models. Rauff (2015) \cite{Rauff2015} talk about how crop models can be used to understand the effects of climate change such as elevated nitrogen levels, CO2 levels, temperature and precipitation changes on crop development, growth and yield. For example, sudden onset of warm and humid conditions can lead to plant disease proliferation and cause crop yield loss and financial setbacks for farmers and geographical regions. It is a difficult task to produce a comprehensible, operational representation of a part of reality, which grasps the essential elements and mechanisms of that real world system and even more demanding, when the complex systems encountered in environmental management \cite{Rauff2015}.

A few kinds of crop models have been developed so far, ranging from empirical models to explanatory models. A widely used approach to this prediction problem is to rely on numerical models that emulate the main processes of crop growth and development. Lobell et al (2010)\cite{Lobell2010} state that these models are typically developed and tested using experimental trials and thus offer the distinct advantage of leveraging decades of research on crop physiology and reproduction, agronomy, and soil science, among other disciplines. Yet these models also require extensive input data on cultivar (plant varieties produced by selective breeding), management, and soil conditions that are unavailable in many parts of the world. 

The presence of all the data required for these models still requires calibration, which is difficult due to the high amount of uncertainty in the model parameters. Often, parameter uncertainty is ignored in such complex models and parameter values are picked through subjective deliberation. Iizumi et al. (2009) estimated distributions of parameter values from Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques with the widths of the distributions reflecting the inability of historical rice, maize yield datasets to effectively constrain parameter values. They found that parameter uncertainties translated to larger uncertainties in projecting yield responses to climate change. They concluded that uncertainty of climate change impact assessment on crop yield may increase if future climate projections are fed to crop models with parameters optimized under current climate conditions \cite{Iizumi2009}.

Statistical models, on the other hand, trained with historical crop yield data, and made of relatively simple linear regression ensembles provide  a common alternative to the process based models described above. These methods include the following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item time series methods - based on time series data from a single point or geographical area.
  \item panel methods - these methods rely on variations in both time and feature space. 
  \item cross sectional methods - based solely on variations in space.
\end{enumerate}
Time series methods are often limited by availability of data but have the advantage of capturing the variability for the chosen location. Panel and cross-sectional methods assume common parameter values across all locations and are prone to errors from omission of features like soil conditions or fertilizer uptake. The main advantages of statistical models are their limited reliance on field calibration data, and their transparent assessment of model uncertainties. For example, if a model does a poor job of representing crop yield responses to climate, this will be reflected in a low coefficient of determination ($R^2$) between modeled and observed quantities, as well as a large confidence interval around model coefficients and predictions. Although process-based models could in theory be accompanied with similar statistics, in practice they rarely are \cite{Lobell2010}. A few shortcomings with statistical models include co-linearity problems and assumptions of stationarity of the underlying ecological processes, which is an extremely important problem due to rapidly changing ecologies on the planet as a result of global warming. 

Lobell et al.\cite{Lobell2010} recognized the need for a systematic evaluation of statistical methods in predicting crop yields to climate and recommended that efforts be made to determine the specific conditions under which their predictions are likely to be misleading. This would help in quantifying the common errors that arise from using these simpler if imperfect approaches. Researchers \cite{Shi2013} \cite{lobell2009climate} have found that statistical models work best at large spatio-temporal scales like national or regional levels. Other researchers have highlighted the difference between understanding the impact of climate change on crop growth and on crop yields. Predicting crop yields involves understanding predictors that aren't reflected in the physiological crop growth models explaining their inability to reliably predict crop yields. This problem maybe considered as one of dimensionality reduction where multiple predictors need to be aggregated at regional, provincial and national levels and temporal scales like monthly or seasonal climatic variable changes.
\subsection{Objective}
The main goal of this report is to evaluate the accuracy of context unaware statistical models at accounting for the uncertainty found in the task of crop yield prediction. Statistical models that use Neural Networks and Multiple Adaptive Regressive Splines are to be built using historical annual crop yield, seasonal temperature and precipitation levels and assess their accuracy at predicting yields using measures such as error bounds, confidence intervals on predictions and compare these measures of variability with similar measures obtained by crop growth models. Many researchers \cite{Wolfram2010} \cite{iizumi2013prediction} \cite{Gonzalez-Sanchez2014} have found that statistical models can explain variability in crop yields due to climate change better than crop growth models do. The important features that explain this variability were found to be seasonal variations in weather, precipitation, fertilizer intake and crop breeding effects. This study aims to make similar inferences about the importance of climatic and geophysical factors on crop yields based on the results obtained from the Neural Network and MARS models.

\section{Data and Methods}
\subsection{Datasets}
Data was obtained from the World Bank's data on socioeconomic indicators for all countries in the world. This data includes historical agricultural indicators like crop yields, fertilizers used, agriculture related carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide emissions and extensive climate data going back to 1901.

The crop yield data obtained was for annual cereal production in India from 1961 to 2013. Cereals are a plant family consisting primarily of wheat, oats and corn. 

\subsection{Methods}
All data was cleaned and was preprocessed to remove
